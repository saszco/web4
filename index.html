    <div class="about_content">
      <p>Kyiv has a long, rich, and often stormy history.
        Its beginnings are lost in antiquity. Archaeological findings of stone and
        bone implements, the remains of primitive dwellings built of wood and skins,
        and large accumulations of mammoths’ bones indicate that the first settlements in the
        vicinity date from the Late Paleolithic Period (some 40,000 to 15,000 years ago).</p>
